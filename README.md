# JavaScript Intensity Surface Grid Chart

![JavaScript Intensity Surface Grid Chart](surfaceIntensityGrid-darkGold.png)

This demo application belongs to the set of examples for LightningChart JS, data visualization library for JavaScript.

LightningChart JS is entirely GPU accelerated and performance optimized charting library for presenting massive amounts of data. It offers an easy way of creating sophisticated and interactive charts and adding them to your website or web application.

The demo can be used as an example or a seed project. Local execution requires the following steps:

-   Make sure that relevant version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is installed
-   Open the project folder in a terminal:

          npm install              # fetches dependencies
          npm start                # builds an application and starts the development server

-   The application is available at _http://localhost:8080_ in your browser, webpack-dev-server provides hot reload functionality.


## Description

This example showcases the `SurfaceGridSeries` feature of LightningChart JS and more specifically its ability to process two different data sets:

-   Height data set
-   Intensity data set

Both of these data sets are structured similarly (one value for each column & row combination in surface grid), but serve different purposes. Height data set is used to alter the visible shape of the series, while the Intensity data set can **optionally** be used for coloring the series.

See [Surface Grid Chart Example](https://lightningchart.com/lightningchart-js-interactive-examples/examples/lcjs-example-0912-surfaceGrid.html) for a usage scenario, which only uses the Height data set.

This example generates a different data set for Height and Intensity data, and colors the surface according to the Intensity data set, effectively forming a 4-dimensional data visualization (X, Y, Z, Color).
